                <h3>Human-Wildlife Conflict</h3>
                <p>Human-wildlife conflict poses a significant threat to leopards in Sri Lanka. As their habitats overlap with human settlements, conflicts arise, leading to negative consequences for both leopards and communities. Conservation efforts include implementing community-based initiatives and secure livestock practices.</p>

                <p>The illegal wildlife trade is a grave threat to leopards, driven by demand for their skins and body parts. This illicit trade contributes to population decline. Conservation measures involve strict law enforcement, awareness campaigns, and collaboration with international organizations.</p>
